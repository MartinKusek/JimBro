# JimBro

JimBro is a simple app built in Swift that helps you track your progress in the gym. 

## Idea

The main idea behind this app is progressive overload (when you gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions in your strength training routine). By following this method you'll keep your muscles challenged and youâ€™ll get stronger faster. But people often forget how much weight or what number of repetitions they did in their last training session. JimBro solves that problem.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

The biggest challenge was the implementation of core data which was the reason I picked this project. In the previous courses I attended, Core Data was just briefly discussed. By researching and implementing it in my project I learned a lot about local data persistence (User defaults, Core Data, Realm). Additionally, to read and check the data I was saving I used and learned about SQL Lite. I learned how to navigate through view controllers using a Navigation Controller, use data to fill table view cells, and make custom cells using xibs. Also, I tried to follow the MVC design pattern and write code that is clean and easy to read.
